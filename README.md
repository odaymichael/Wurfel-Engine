### The Goal

1. Provide a normal open source game engine because open source games are always geek games (often in ASCII)
2. An easy engine for strategy or adventure games
3. Minecraft is hip, so are blocks.

### Features

    Open Source:
        Well commented
        Clean code: no geeky code with strange indent and names
        No licensing costs
    Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)
    Map Streaming: make maps as big as you want like in Minecraft
    Three Dimensions: make maps with high buildings or deep dungeons
    Map editor: free & included
    Fast: Wurfelengine renders only what is visible 
    Easy: look at our examples (soon) how easy it is to build a small game
